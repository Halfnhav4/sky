This directory contains simple C examples that can be compiled with Clang to
produce reference LLVM IR. This is used to match up constructs within EQL to
similar constructs in C to make sure that their LLVM IR representation is the
same.

To emit the LLVM IR, execute the following command:

    $ clang -S -emit-llvm my_file.c

The resulting IR file will be `my_file.s`. You can also execute the make
command to generate IR for all the C files:

    $ make llvm-ir-examples
